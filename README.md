# What is Wireframing?  

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a basic outline or skeletal structure of a website or application interface. It represents a simplified version of the product before adding colors, images, or visual details, helping teams visualize the core layout and user flow.  

# Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process  

- **Clarifies ideas:** Transforms abstract concepts into simple visual representations that can be easily discussed.  
- **Saves time and cost:** Making changes to early sketches is much easier and less expensive than altering high-fidelity designs.  
- **Encourages collaboration:** Allows designers, developers, and stakeholders to align on the basic structure before moving to detailed design.  
- **Improves user experience:** Focuses on content organization and interaction flow to ensure usability before visual aesthetics are applied.

# Key Elements of a Wireframe  

A wireframe typically includes several essential elements that define the foundation of a design. These elements guide how users interact with a product and ensure consistency in the overall user experience.  

## 1. Layout Structure  
Defines the overall arrangement of elements on the page.  
- **Purpose:** Ensures that content is organized logically and consistently across pages.  
- **Example:** A booking system checkout page may place the booking summary on the right side and the payment form on the left, making the process intuitive and easy to follow.  

## 2. Navigation  
Outlines how users move between different sections of the website or application.  
- **Purpose:** Helps users find information quickly and move smoothly through the interface.  
- **Example:** A top navigation bar with links to “Home,” “Bookings,” “Profile,” and “Support” allows users to easily access core sections.  

## 3. Content Placement  
Represents where text, images, or interactive components will appear.  
- **Purpose:** Ensures that key information is visible and accessible, improving readability and engagement.  
- **Example:** Placing confirmation details and total booking price near the payment button ensures users see them before completing checkout.  

## 4. Functionality  
Indicates interactive components and their behavior.  
- **Purpose:** Shows how users will interact with the system and what actions they can perform.  
- **Example:** Buttons like “Confirm Booking,” input fields for payment information, or drop-down menus for selecting dates and times highlight the functional parts of the interface.

By combining these elements, wireframes serve as a **blueprint** that ensures both usability and clarity before moving to detailed design stages.
