# What is Wireframing?  

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a basic outline or skeletal structure of a website or application interface. It represents a simplified version of the product before adding colors, images, or visual details, helping teams visualize the core layout and user flow.  

# Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process  

- **Clarifies ideas:** Transforms abstract concepts into simple visual representations that can be easily discussed.  
- **Saves time and cost:** Making changes to early sketches is much easier and less expensive than altering high-fidelity designs.  
- **Encourages collaboration:** Allows designers, developers, and stakeholders to align on the basic structure before moving to detailed design.  
- **Improves user experience:** Focuses on content organization and interaction flow to ensure usability before visual aesthetics are applied.
